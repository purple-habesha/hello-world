# hello-world

To whom it may concern,

I am Eyobel - pronounced ee-yo-bell. I don't know why my parents chose a name rare even in my own country, Ethiopia. 
I guess they think I am special. Maybe I am, as I'm the first from my family to go to college. "Ramy" is the show I enjoyed watching recently, and I like drinking hot chocolate.
